Build a Bot to do basic mathematical operations

Proposed workflow for the Bot

1.
Take two operands and operation as input and show the output

2.
Show the available mathematical operations

•
You can use a simple menu based approach to take the operation

•
Example categories : “addition”, subtraction”, ”multiplication”, “division”

3.
Based on these input show the output for the users

4.
After the flow ends - If a user says ”more operations” , take the new inputs and proceed
